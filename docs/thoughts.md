Multiple modes, triggered by "new-line"-ish characters:
  * Numerical
    * does "traditional" calculations
    * prints each calculation result to the stack
  * Symbolical
    * solves equations leaving variables as variables
    * prepares statements for:
  * Graphing
    * This displays a graph of given data
  * String
    * text manipulation
